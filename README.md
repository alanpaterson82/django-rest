# Mince 'n' Patties

Mince 'n' Patties is my fifth and final portfolio projectand is a content sharing platform focusing on user's interest in food and anything food based. Primarily it is for subscribers to post pictures of any recent meals, creations or experiences, eventually leading to exclusive content for VIP members and recipe sharing at a later date.

The main goal of this project is to build a community where ideas, thoughts and opinions can be shared to generate interesting discussions with others, and to provide culinary inspiration .

The full platform is available to view [here](https://8000-alanpaterson-djangorest-0yj0z1q8uhy.ws-eu110.gitpod.io/).

## Front end Documentation

The front end of this application has full CRUD functionality so that users can register, log-in, like and comment on other posts and also upload their own content.

The landing page is bright, informative and eye-catching and allows you to view the existing feed via the homepage, sign in or sign up for your own account.

The sign in page allows you to access further content by inputting your username and password as standard.

If you navigate to this page but don't already have an account you are prompted to click on 'Sign up now!' And with such mouth watering photography already on display, why wouldn't you?!

The sign up page has further enticing photography and is of a standard format.
